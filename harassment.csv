The term “feminazi” and similar slurs are commonly deployed to equate gender activism with extremism, dismissing legitimate advocacy as fanatical or dangerous. By framing feminists as irrational, unfeminine, or culturally deviant, abusers seek to erode public sympathy and prevent solidarity around women’s rights. Feminists are also often linked with LGBTQ+ rights, framing feminism as foreign or immoral, painting gender equality as an attack on social cohesion rather than a pursuit of justice. Such rhetoric reinforces stigma against both feminists and LGBTQ+ individuals, using fear and disgust to marginalise anyone challenging gender hierarchies.
